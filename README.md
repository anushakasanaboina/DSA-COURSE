# My DSA Practice Journey

Welcome to my **DSA Practice Repository**! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems I have solved, organized by topic. I started learning DSA to improve my problem-solving skills for coding interviews and competitive programming. This repository contains my progress, solutions, and explanations, and I hope it serves as a helpful resource for anyone learning DSA.

## Topics Covered:
- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)**
- **Graphs (BFS, DFS)**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Backtracking**

### Structure:
Each folder contains:
- **Problem Statements**: A brief description of the problem.
- **Solution**: Code in my preferred programming language.
- **Explanation**: Detailed step-by-step approach to solve the problem.

## How to Use:
1. **Fork** this repository to your own account if you'd like to contribute or learn along.
2. **Clone** it to your local machine and start solving problems.
3. Feel free to explore the solutions and explanations.
4. If you'd like to contribute, open a pull request with new problems or improvements.

## Progress Tracking:
I aim to cover each topic systematically. Here's my progress so far:
- âœ… Arrays & Strings: [Completed]
